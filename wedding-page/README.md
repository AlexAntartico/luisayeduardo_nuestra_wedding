# Wedding Page Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a simple static HTML page designed for a wedding celebration. It features a clean and elegant layout with a white-ish background and interactive elements that enhance the user experience.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the wedding page.
- `css/styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the page, including hover effects.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Instructions to View the Page
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Enjoy the interactive wedding page!

## Additional Notes
- The project uses the "Lobster" font for decorative text and "Arial" as a fallback for readability.
- Ensure you have an internet connection if you want to load the Google Fonts for "Lobster".

## CSS Styles
- The body has a light background color (`#f9f9f9`) for a soft appearance.
- The main `<div>` is centered on the page and has a smooth transition effect that enlarges and moves it when hovered over.

Feel free to customize the styles and content to better suit your wedding theme!
